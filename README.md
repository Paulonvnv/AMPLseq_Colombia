# Micro-Haplotype (MHap) Analysis
The purpose of this repository is to introduce researchers at the Laboratory of Genomic Epidemiology of Malaria at Harvard university in the analysis of genotyping information generated through amplicon sequencing (also called Microhaplotype genotyping). This cover:

1. Importing and handling tables in CIGAR format in R environment.

2. Adding metadata.

3. Performance of the genotyping process.

4. Molecular surveillance of drug resistance.

5. Monitoring transmission intensity.

6. Measuring geographic connectivity.
