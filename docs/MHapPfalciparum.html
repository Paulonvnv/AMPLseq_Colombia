<h1 class="title toc-ignore"><em>AMPLseq</em>: Targeted amplicon
sequencing panel for <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em></h1>
<h4 class="author">Neafsey Lab</h4>

</div>


<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce researchers at Neafsey
Lab in the analysis of genotypic information of <em>Plasmodium
falciparum</em> generated through the targeted amplicon sequencing panel
AMPLseq. This tutorial will cover:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Importing and handling tables in CIGAR format in R
environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding metadata.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance of the genotyping process.</p></li>
<li><p>Molecular surveillance of drug resistance.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring transmission intensity.</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring geographic connectivity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this tutorial we will use a data set of 1300 samples distributed
across 8 sequencing runs as a example. These samples comes from a
collaboration with the group of Caucaseco, which has collected samples
of <em>P. falciparum</em> from 2020 to 2022 in 5 municipalities located
in Colombia. The data set has geographic information, however this
information is encoded to protect the origin of the participants.</p>
<div id="importing-and-handling-tables-in-cigar-format-in-r-environment"
class="section level2">
<h2>Importing and handling tables in CIGAR format in R environment</h2>
<p>Our first step will be to call all required packages and functions in
the R environment:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>source(&#39;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/functions_and_libraries/amplseq_required_libraries.R&#39;)
source(&#39;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/functions_and_libraries/amplseq_functions.R&#39;)
sourceCpp(&#39;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/functions_and_libraries/hmmloglikelihood.cpp&#39;)
sourceCpp(&#39;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/functions_and_libraries/Rcpp_functions.cpp&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This tutorial start with .tsv table in CIGAR format that has been
generated by the <a
href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/malaria-amplicon-pipeline">malaria-amplicon-pipeline</a>
of our lab. The output of this pipeline has the following structure:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{c|c:c:c:c:c:c}
\text{sampleID}&amp;Gene_1,Allele_1&amp;Gene_1,Allele_2&amp;...&amp;Gene_1,Allele_k&amp;...
&amp; Gene_m, Allele_{k_m}\\ \hline ID_1 &amp; \text{Read counts}
&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ \hdashline ... &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\ \hdashline ID_n
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \end{array}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math inline">\(Allele\)</span> is coded in
Pseudo-CIGAR format, typing “.” for the reference allele, <span
class="math inline">\([0-9]*[A,T,C,G]\)</span> for each point mutation
observed, and <span
class="math inline">\([0-9]*[D,I]=[A,T,C,G]*\)</span> for indels
(Insertions and Deletions). The numbers before the letters denotes the
position in the amplicon where the polymorphism is located</p>
<p>These Pseudo-CIGAR tables are stored in the server of the lab using
the following path structure:</p>
<p><code>"STUDYNAME/RUNNAME/dada2/run_dada2/CIGARVariants.out.tsv"</code></p>
<p>As this structure is maintained across all studies in the lab, we
have created a function called <code>read_cigar_tables</code> that only
requires two arguments: <code>paths</code> (name of the folder of the
study or the <code>STUDYNAME</code>), and <code>sample_id_pattern</code>
(a pattern string in the IDs of the samples that differentiate them from
controls). In case you don’t want to differentiate samples from
controls, set this argument equals to <code>"."</code>. For this
particular example, the path will be
<code>"data/sequencing_data/"</code> , while the pattern will be
<code>"ID"</code>. In case all <code>".tvs"</code> files are stored in
one folder, you can use the argument <code>files = list_of_files</code>
instead of the argument <code>paths</code>, where
<code>list_of_files</code> is a vector with the names of all files we
want to read.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cigar_object = read_cigar_tables(paths = &quot;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/data/Pfal_example2/Seq_runs/&quot;, sample_id_pattern = &quot;^SP&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This function generates a S4 cigar object containing two data.frames,
1) a <code>cigar_table</code>, where genotyping information is stored in
cigar format; and 2) a <code>metadata</code> table with 4 variables
(columns), <strong>a)</strong> <code>Sample_id</code> which contains
samples Id’s; <strong>b)</strong> <code>run</code> which contains the
run number (or the name of the folter where the fastq’s for that run
wehere stored), information that is useful for comparing performance
across batches of samples; <strong>c)</strong>
<code>order_in_plate</code>, useful to identify rare amplifications
patterns in the plate; and <strong>d)</strong> <code>typeofSamp</code>
which differentiates between controls and samples of interest. In order
to view these tables use <code>View(cigar_table$cigar_table)</code> or
<code>View(cigar_table$metadata)</code> in the console.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If there are duplicated samples, only the
replicated with the highest read depth across all loci will be kept.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-metadata" class="section level2">
<h2>Adding Metadata</h2>
<p>Metadata would come from different sources, sometimes the sample ID
incorporates metadata in their coding system, other times metadata can
be stored in a different table, having one column specifying the sample
ID. In the case of this data set, we will perform the analysis at the
level of Municipality and in intervals of three months starting from the
first day of collection of samples. Then, to add sampling location,
month of collection and other metadata we are going to merge (using the
function <code>left_join()</code>) our <code>metadata</code> table in
the <code>cigar_object</code> to a metadata table from an external
source that contain all the metadata associated with these samples.
Thus, we will upload a metadata table from an external source. For this
purpose we are going to import the file called <code>metadata.csv</code>
into our R environment.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Upload metadata from an external source
metadata = read.csv(&#39;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/data/Pfal_example2/colombia_metadata_cleaned.csv&#39;)

# Merge the external metadata with our cigar_object
cigar_object@metadata = left_join(cigar_object@metadata,
                              metadata,
                              by = &#39;Sample_id&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We can use ggplot2 to plot the sample size (number of genotyped
samples) by Municipality over time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Define the temporal unit of analysis
dates = sort(unique(cigar_object@metadata$Quarter_of_Collection))

# Define the geographic unite of analysis
pop_levels = levels(as.factor(cigar_object@metadata$Subnational_level2))
pop_colors = c(&quot;firebrick3&quot;, &quot;dodgerblue3&quot;, &quot;gold3&quot;, &quot;darkseagreen3&quot;, &quot;lightsalmon2&quot;)

plot_temporal_collection_of_samples = cigar_object@metadata %&gt;%

  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter_of_Collection, y = nsamples, fill = factor(Subnational_level2,
                                                              levels = pop_levels)))+

        legend.position =  &quot;none&quot;)+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = dates)

</div>
<div id="performance-of-the-genotyping-process" class="section level2">
<h2>Performance of the genotyping process</h2>
<p>A first step in analyzing the genotypic data is to measure the
performance of the genotyping process in terms of the proportion of
samples amplified by each locus (amplification rate by locus) and the
proportion of loci amplified per each sample (amplification rate per
sample). In order to perform that task, we are going to convert our
cigar table to a more manageable (easy to read for the user) format
called ampseq format, where amplicons or genes are going to be in
columns, samples in rows, and the allele in cigar format is going to be
in each cell of the matrix together with the read count of that allele
in the sample.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{c|c:c:c:c}
\text{sampleID}&amp;Gene_1&amp;Gene_2&amp;...&amp; Gene_m\\ \hline ID_1
&amp; Allele_{i_{i \in Alleles_{Gene_1}}}\text{:Read count}
&amp;&amp;&amp; \\ \hdashline ... &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\ \hdashline ID_n
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \end{array}\)</span></p>
<p>For that purpose we are going to use the function
<code>cigar2ampseq</code>. This function requires 4 arguments. First a
<code>cigar_object</code> (containing the cigar_table and the metadata).
Then <code>markers</code>, which is a table with the set of markers and
their names (in a column named <code>amplicon</code>). This argument is
optional, and in case is <code>NULL</code>, the name of the amplicons
will be extracted from the columns in the <code>cigar_object</code>, but
information regarding chormosome location (information required to
stimaed reladness under the hmmIBD algorithm) and length of the amplicon
will be missing. The next arguments are <code>min_abd</code> and
<code>min_ratio</code>, which are the minimum abundance (minimum read
count) required to call an allele and the minimum ratio between the
minor and major alleles in a polyclonal sample. By default these two
arguments are 10 and 0.1 respectively. The last argument is
<code>remove_controls</code>, by default is <code>FALSE</code>, but if
change ti <code>TRUE</code> the information of the controls will be
stored in a separated slot. Thus, this function automatically
differentiate between controls and samples of interest, and its output
is a <code>ampseq_object</code> S4 list with 6 slots: <code>gt</code>
where the genotypic information of the samples of interest is stored in
a <code>ampseq</code> format; the <code>metadata</code> of the samples
of interest; <code>controls</code> with all the information of the
controls; <code>markers</code> containing the information of the markers
such as the chromosome location; and other empty slots required for the
next steps such as <code>loci_performance</code> and
<code>pop_summary</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># (alleles and abundance will be in cells)
markers = read.csv(&quot;~/Documents/Github/MHap-Analysis/docs/reference/Pfal_3D7/markers.csv&quot;)
ampseq = cigar2ampseq(cigar_object, markers = markers, min_abd = 10, min_ratio = .1, remove_controls = T)</code></pre>
<div id="removing-pcr-artefacts" class="section level3">
<h3>Removing PCR artefacts</h3>
<p>There are some artifacts that the <code>dada2</code> pipeline doesn’t
resolve well like the generation of chimeras (artificial fusion of two
different haplotypes during the PCR amplification) in polyclonal
samples. That is the case of the alleles <code>PF3D7_1302900,1G</code>
and <code>PF3D7_0612900,215A</code> that are observed in polyclonal
infections only. So we are going to proceed to remove both alleles from
our <code>cigar_table</code>. Additionally, <code>PvDHFR</code> locus
was amplified in order to detect mixed infections with <em>Plasmodium
vivax</em>, so we are going to remove this locus too as this locus is
not of our interest in this tutorial.</p>

<p>We can also use the function <code>loci_amplification_rate</code> to
measure the proportion of samples that have been amplified by each
amplicon marker. This function requires two arguments, the
<code>ampseq_object</code> and <code>threshold</code>, which defines the
minimum proportion of samples that a marker should amplify in order to
be keep it for further analysis (default 0.65). All markers below this
<code>threshold</code> will be removed and stored in a different slot in

<div id="molecular-surveillance-of-drug-resistance"
class="section level2">
<h2>Molecular surveillance of drug resistance</h2>
<p>Surveillance of polymorphisms or allelic variants associated with
resistance against antimalarials is of the utmost importance in public
health. That is why our panel of markers includes 5 genes (9 markers in
total, some genes are genotyped by more than one marker) that have
polymorphisms associated with antimalarial resistance. In this section
we will identify the different haplotypes of these genes present in our
data set, and we will determine the frequency of each haplotype in each
study area and in each quarter of the year. For this we will use the
function <code>drug_resistant_haplotypes</code> which has 7 arguments.
The first argument is the <code>ampseq_object</code>. The second is a
table with the reference alleles for each gene, and the polymorphisms
associated with resistance. The structure of this table is as
follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{c|c:c:c} \text{Chromosome}
&amp; \text{Gene_ID} &amp; \text{Description} &amp; \text{Mutation}
&amp; \text{Anotation} \\ \text{Pf3D7_04_v3} &amp; \text{PF3D7_0417200}
&amp; dhfr &amp; \text{N51I} &amp; \text{Pyrimethamine resistance} \\
... \end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the mutation describes the reference amino acid (sensitive to
the drug), the position in the amino acid chain, and finally the amino
acid associated with resistance.</p>
<p>The third and fourth arguments refer to the common name of the gene
(or the name by which it is identified in the <code>markers</code> table
in the <code>ampseq_object</code>) and the gene ID in the gff file of
the referential strain (in this case strain 3D7). The fifth and sixth
arguments are the .gff and .fasta files of the genome of the reference
strain, and the last argument, <code>variables</code>, is a vector that
has the columns of the <code>metadata</code> table that will be used to
define the subpopulations and generate the report graph. For this
particular example we will define as
<code>variables = c('Sample_id', 'Subnational_level2', 'Quarter_of_Collection')</code>,
where <code>Sample_id</code>, is the column that we will use to map the
data, <code>Subnational_level2</code> is the column to define the area
of study, and <code>Quarter_of_Collection</code> defines the time
scale.</p>
<p>The function generates a list with 3 tables and a graph. The first
table contains the haplotypes found in each sample (rows) for each gene
(columns). Each number in the haplotype indicates a position in the
amino acid chain, the letter before the number indicates the reference
allele (with sensitive phenotype), and the letter after the number is
the allele observed in the sample. If the letters are in capital
letters, that allele in that position has been previously reported as
resistant, whereas the letters in lower case indicate that it is the
first time that position has been reported as polymorphic. In case the
sample is polyclonal, each allele observed is separated by the following
symbol <code>|</code>, and the order in which they are reported is based
on their read count. Null data, defined as sections of the gene that
have not been amplified, are completed with the question mark
<code>?</code>.</p>
<p>The second table contains the inferred phenotype for each sample
(rows) for each gene (columns). The third table contains the count of
each haplotype in the population (number of times observed) and its
frequency in the population (defined based on geographic and temporal
information). It is important to note that polyclonal samples are
included in this calculation, so the denominator is defined as the total
number of haplotypes found in the populations. Remember that if we run
this analysis after filtering not amplified samples and loci, some
polymorphism will not be included. To report all mutations included in
our panel of markers associated with drug resistance, we have to recover
that information from the slot <code>discarded_loci</code>.</p>

<h2>Monitoring transmission intensity</h2>
<p>The transmission of Malaria has an effect on the evolutionary
processes that affect the parasite population. Thus, various genetic
indicators are used to identify changes in the intensity of transmission
at a spatial and temporal level. One of these indicators is the
prevalence of polyclonal infections, or the coexistence of two or more
different clones (haplotypes) within the infected individual. As the
human parasite genome is haploid, the presence of a single haplotype is
expected. The presence of two or more different haplotypes in the sample
may be due to the transmission of two or more different genotypes from
the same bite (co-infection), or the acquisition of parasites by
multiple infections or independent bites (super-infection); and both
processes are related to the intensity of transmission. In low
transmission there are few infective bites, so there is little chance
that a person can acquire a super-infection or co-infection, and
therefore most infections are monoclonal. On the other hand, when the
necessary conditions exist for the increase in the mosquito population
and the interaction between it and the human is favored,
super-infections and co-infections increase, generating an increase in
the prevalence of polyclonal infections.</p>
<p>The genetic relatedness between parasites is also affected by the
intensity of transmission. As we mentioned previously, in low
transmission scenarios monoclonal infections are favored, so when an
infected person is bitten, a single haplotype is transmitted and
self-fertilization of the parasite occurs in the mosquito (sexual
reproduction of two genetically identical or related haplotypes). This
mechanism of propagation by inbreeding is called clonal propagation, and
it causes all the alleles of a haplotype to segregate together and not
independently, thus increasing the genetic relatedness in the
population.</p>
<p>The parasite effective population size (number of individuals in the
population that explains the magnitude of the effect of genetic drift in
the population) and its diversity, are also influenced by transmission.
The increase in transmission is a consequence of the reproductive
success of the different lineages of circulating parasites and the
increase in their effective population size. These circumstances
increase the introduction of new variants in the population (increase in
the population mutation rate or <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>), the number of polymorphic sites,
the richness of alleles of each polymorphic site (number of alleles per
locus), and genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity of the
population (probability of selecting two different alleles by chance).
On the other hand, when transmission decreases and the effective
population size is reduced, and genetic drift causes the random fixation
of alleles, and the diversity of the population is reduced. However, the
effective size of the population and its diversity are also strongly
influenced by the introduction of new variants as a result of migration
and the genetic structure of the parasite population, so the
relationship between these metrics and transmission is not linear.</p>

<h3>Complexity of infection and transmission</h3>
<p>In this section we will focus on describing the relationship between
the intensity of transmission, inferred through the number of samples
collected, and the proportion of polyclonal infections. To do this, we
will first use the function <code>get_polygenomic</code> to identify
polyclonal infections, determine their complexity of infection (number
of different clones coexisting in the sample), and the number of
heterozygous loci per sample. This information is automatically added to
the <code>metadata</code> table of the ampseq_object. We will then
proceed to describe the distribution of heterozygous loci per sample,
the COI, and the proportion of polyclonal infections in each population.
Finally, we will describe the temporal change in the proportion of
polyclonal infections and its association with the number of samples
collected.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ampseq_filtered = get_polygenomic(ampseq_object = ampseq_filtered, 
                                  strata = &quot;Subnational_level2&quot;,
                                  na.rm = FALSE,
                                  filters = NULL)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Filter NHetLoci &gt;= 1 will be applied&quot;
## [1] &quot;Filter Fws &lt; 1 will be applied&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>get_polygenomic</code> generates 3 tables:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A vector that describes for each loci the proportion of polyclonal
samples detected. This vector is added to the loci_performance table in
our ampseq_object if we set <code>update_popsummary = T</code>. This
information is useful in order to identify genotyping errors that are
not filtered out in the denoising pipeline and the identification of
chimeras by dada2. That is the case of the alleles
<code>PF3D7_1302900,1G</code> and <code>PF3D7_0612900,215A</code> for
instance.</li>

<h3>Relatedness and Transmission</h3>
<p>Relatedness is defined as the probability that, at any locus in the
genome, the alleles sampled from two different individuals are identical
by descent (IBD). A Hidden Markov Model based method was developed for
the estimation of relatedness (HMMIBD), where the relatedness or <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is estimated as a function of the
haplotype of the two sampled parasites (<span
class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y_j\)</span>), the frequency of the alleles in the
population, the physical distance between loci, the recombination rate
(<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>), a switching rate of the
Markov chain (<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), and a constant
genotyping error rate (<span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>).</p>
<p>In this section we will measure the pairwise genetic relatedness, and
calculate the proportion of pairwise comparisons that have a relatedness
<span class="math inline">\(\ge 0.99\)</span> within and between
operational units. For that we are going to use the following

<li><code>pairwise_hmmIBD</code>: computes pairwise genetic relatedness
using the HMMIBD algorithm implemented in <a

automatically all pairwise comparisons will be computed. Its output is a
long format data.frame of all pairwise comparisons. This function is
computationally exhaustive, so it has parallel argument to speed up the
calculation. In the current example, the matrix is been generated

<h2>Measuring geographic connectivity</h2>
<p>Malaria transmission is heterogeneous throughout the Colombian
territory, and it is mainly concentrated in transmission foci where
demographic and environmental factors favor the interaction between the
two hosts of the parasite, humans and Anopheles mosquitoes.
Operationally, disease control units are defined based on sub-national
administrative divisions. The connectivity or dispersal pattern of the
parasite between these geographic units may limit progress in disease
control if activities are not properly coordinated. This connectivity is
mainly influenced by human movement, and can be inferred by estimating
the proportion of genetically closely related parasites between the
different areas.</p>
